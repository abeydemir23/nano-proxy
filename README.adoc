= nano-proxy
Because everything is micro these days

== What

Started as an excuse to play with the amazing
http://netty.io[netty] framework. I just needed to proxy
traffic from a private network (10.0.0.x) via a public machine.

Then I realized I could play with a bunch of cool stuff (Traffic shaping, hex dumps, connection control, load balancing)

== WIP

Not really usable, at the moment. but I had to start pushing something to github.

== Wish list

* [ ] TCP and HTTP proxies
* [ ] Channel Pooling
* [ ] Load balancing with ribbon
* [ ] Tests, tests, tests

== Screenshots
